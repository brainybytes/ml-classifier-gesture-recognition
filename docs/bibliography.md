While some of this work shares some characteristics I developed the Quantized Classifer concept and designed independently.   I had built  KNN, Ensemble and Bayesian engines previously along with a number of statistical systems for improving search results so they inevitably influenced my approach.

Proposes a unique way of removing pieces of data to isolate what features are used to by Deep Learning  Neural networks to classify text.   Also uses examples to show why this is a important process because if you can not verify how the CNN is making decisions you can not know when it will break.

   Posted by Marc Borowczak March-30-2016.   or [linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/benchmarking-20-machine-learning-models-accuracy-speed-marc-borowczak)  I am always a bit skeptical of raw comparisons for various engines especially those that compare results from many approaches because and expert in any approach can generally produce superior results with that approach.  He does seem objective but I could not find where they explicitly isolated test data from training data so the results may be skewed.
